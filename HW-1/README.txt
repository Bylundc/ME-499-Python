In order to run the integrate function the user just needs to run the script. The function will then prompt the user for the coefficients of the quadriatic function that they wish to integrate. Then the interval on which they wish to integrate on, and finally whether or not they wish to change the default step size. The program will then approximate the integral based on these parameters and return the value compared to the actual value. The graph of the absolute error of this function will then appear showing how the error changes with step size. Despite all the jagged edges the general trend is that as the step size is decreased, increasing the number of rectangles approximated with, the smaller the absolute error is. 

The area function runs in a similar way. The user will be prompted for the circle they wish to approximate the area of, then two corners of the square that will encompass the circle. One thing to note about the square is that if the square is smaller than the circle then the returned area will be that of the square. Next the number of samples used to approximate the area will be asked. Based on these parameters the approximated area of the circle will be displayed as well as the actual area. Then the graph of the absolute error of an the approximated circle will appear as sample size is increased. Again, despite the jagged edges, the trend concludes that as the sample size is increased the error decreases.
